# Major Project Proposal

## Descripton
Going to attempt coding a 3d maze (or the illusion of "steping" thorough a 3d maze using 2d images) in the style of 
retro maze games. If succsessful, turn it into an escape room style puzzle where you collect things in the maze to unlock a door 
at the end. If succsessful, add create a storyline.

## Needs to have list
week 1
- plan out project
  
week 2-3
 - research and impliment the 3d maze
 - make player navigate through the maze/ flip through each image using the arrowkeys
   
week 3-4
- music + sound design
-implement ways to apply objects to needed puzzles
*look at coding for previous escape room project

## Nice to have
week 4-5
- clear up assests and make it aesthetically appealing
- add a storyline that's told through narraration
- extra effects and animations
- if maze if functional add collectable objects
